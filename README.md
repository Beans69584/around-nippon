Around Nippon is a passion project which I've been working on for a while now. It's a simple Next.js web application designed to help people travelling to Japan. The design emphasises a focus on intuitive navigation and a modest design. The application is designed to be used on desktop and mobile devices and comes with multiple languages available.

## Features

- **Itinerary Planner**: Easily plan a trip to Japan with a simple interface that includes a google maps integration to help you visualise your trip.
- **Travel Insights**: Access a wide range of information about Japan, including travel tips, cultural insights, and more.
- **Language Support**: The application is available in multiple languages, including English, Japanese, and Chinese (Simplified and Traditional).
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
